These files can be used to start PLFS daemons at system startup.

Files:
- plfs.init: init.d file to be used on RedHat systems
- plfs.init.suse: init.d file to be used on SUSE systems (like Cray)
- plfs.sysconfig: sysconfig file to be used in conjunction with plfs.init*

Setup:
As root, do the following:
1) Copy either plfs.init or plfs.init.suse to /etc/init.d/plfs
2) Copy plfs.sysconfig to /etc/sysconfig/plfs
3) Modify variables in /etc/sysconfig/plfs to match the PLFS configuration on
   the system. Please see the comments in that file for help. A working 
   /etc/plfsrc should already be in place.
4) Add PLFS to chkconfig: chkconfig --add plfs

Start PLFS deamons:
chkconfig start plfs

To stop deamons:
chkconfig stop plfs

Removal:
Do the Setup steps in reverse, removing instead of adding.
